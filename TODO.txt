Embeddings
-SPOTIFY HOMETOWN
    -Get top songs, take best summaries (see below) and apply k-cluster for biggest set
-Script to go through all unique playlists and get embedding, store in vector database (only has to run if it's not in the DB)
-Script to take a song, get all the playlists it's in and get the best descriptor of it using k cluster, then store it
    -Either of these last two may be done in the contribute and neighbours endpoints instead
-Advanced feature: regional summary of many songs together (zoom out)
-Word neighbours mode vs. corrlelation neighbours
